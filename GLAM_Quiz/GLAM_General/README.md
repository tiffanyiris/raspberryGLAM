# Overview
An MCQ quiz made entirely in Python, using the module tkinter. This was a project for school turned into a competition for Ardit Sucle's Python How Discord Server. There are images as well, but my program doesn't require you to download the images, it gets them from the internet.

# Requirements
You need to have the python libraries requests, pillow, and beautifulsoup4. In case you don't have any of them, do "pip install *library_name*" in order to install them. 

```
pip install requests
pip install pillow
pip install bs4
```

# Other important details
You also need to have a reliable internet connection, as this program gets images from the internet, and needs a good internet connection in order to make the get requests to the image urls.

That's it, hope you like the quiz.
